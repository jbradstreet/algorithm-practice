# algorithm-practice

For the past month, I've been working on getting better at problem solving through code.
I try to start each day by solving a problem on [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseBasicAlgorithmScripting) or [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com)

There are a few other places I visit as well for practice, I'll post about them as I go through.

Anyway, I realized that there currently wasn't anything demonstrating my work at improving my skills in this area, so I've started this github in an effort to start doing just that. A repo that I started doing exercises from months ago is DailyProgrammer, but that is a private repo and all the work I've done there won't be shown to the public. So sad. =(
